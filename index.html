            Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies.
            The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future.
            We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly.
            To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator.
            To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher.
            This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips.
            Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models.    
            It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.
            We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

            Our method distills a many-step, bidirectional video diffusion model <strong>s<sub>data</sub></strong> into
            a 4-step, causal generator <strong>G<sub>ϕ</sub></strong>.
            The training process consists of two stages:
            (1) Student Initialization: We initialize the causal student by pretraining it on a small set of ODE
            solution pairs generated by the bidirectional teacher.
            This step helps stabilize the subsequent distillation training.
            (2) Asymmetric Distillation: Using the <em>bidirectional</em> teacher model, we train the <em>causal</em>
            student generator through a distribution matching distillation loss.

            Additionally, based on our human evaluation, our fast model surpasses competing approaches—such as
            CogVideoX, PyramidFlow, MovieGen, and our bidirectional teacher—all of which are significantly slower by
            several orders of magnitude.

            We compare existing length extrapolation methods in LLMs and image diffusion transformers, which often cause temporal repetition or motion deceleration. In contrast, our method generates new, temporally coherent content that evolves smoothly, achieving superior performance. Below, we highlight the repeated frames with a red box, which correspond to the beginning of the video.
